# clj-check

`lein check` alternative for [Clojure CLI tool](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli)

You don't have to have Leiningen to check your codebase anymore :-)

## Usage

Add the following to your `deps.edn`:

```clj
:aliases
 {:check
  {:extra-deps
   {com.github.athos/clj-check
    {:git/url "https://github.com/athos/clj-check.git"
     :sha     "9e9282a6455f58a2015d267ad503b812ec6cdeb3"}}
   :exec-fn clj-check.check/check}
```

If your project has its codebase under some directories other than `src` (say `src/clj` and `src/cljc`), specify them as the command line arguments as follows:

```clj
:aliases
 {:check
  {...
   :exec-args
    {:source-paths ["src/clj" "src/cljc"]}}}
```


Then, run `clj-check` via the declared alias:

```
clj -X:check
```

OR

Run `clj-check` with CLI overrides
```
clj -X:check :source-paths "[\"src/clj\"]"
```
